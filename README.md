Welcome to my GH page :) Nothing here, yeah.

I have got a good grasp of: JS, ReactJS

I know about: Firebase

Planning to learn: MongoDB, React Native, C#?

Incoming release: Project Unknown. Preview: projunk.vercel.app (dumb URL, I know)

Features coming to this website:

- A place to share videos.

- Chat (if I actually get the time).

Fixes needed:

- Comment and reply system.

- Accessibility (75 score bonk).

- SEO.

- UI.

- Change the logo (I don't like getting into troubles with msft, of friggin' course).

Noice, I'm addicted.
